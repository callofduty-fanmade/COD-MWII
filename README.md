### CAMPAIGN
- **A New Immersive Campaign Experiance:**
Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® II is the sequel to 2019’s blockbuster Modern Warfare®. Featuring the return of the iconic, team leader Captain John Price, the fearless John "Soap" MacTavish, the seasoned Sergeant Kyle "Gaz” Garrick, and the lone wolf himself, fan favorite Simon “Ghost” Riley, players will witness what makes Task Force 141 the legendary squad it is today.

- **Welcome to Task Force 141:**
From small-scale, high-stakes infiltration tactics to highly classified missions, players will need to leverage new weapons, vehicles, and cutting-edge equipment to take on their enemies. Gear up and take the fight offshore as you siege enemies underwater, breach a highly fortified enemy base, infil along the canals, and liberate much-needed allies at a black site hidden within the mountains.

### COOPERATIVE
